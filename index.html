<h2> Here at the Roasters, we are leading the way in the latest GoPiGo innovation. We are currently developing a GoPiGo that will drive itself. </h2>

<h3> Currently, we are developing the software that will enable the GoPiGo to drive itself. Our first step will be to assemble the GoPiGO and get the software and hardware communicating. After we get the GoPiGo to do the basic movements of forward, backward, left and right. Then, our next step will be to get the GoPiGo to travel and spell out ROASTERS!! Before long, we also want to be able to get the GoPiGo to avoid objects and find the best path to travel across a room.</h3>
